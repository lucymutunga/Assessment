        <p>The first two operands are both numbers (5 and 5), so they are added together to produce the value 10. However, the third operand is a string ("5"), so instead of performing addition, JavaScript performs string concatenation. 
            The number 10 is converted to a string, and then concatenated with the string "5". The resulting string "105" is then assigned to the variable sum.</p>
